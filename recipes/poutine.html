    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An authentic Canadian dish from Quebec, poutine is made using french fries, cheese curds, and gravy.
        Of course, this is only the most basic variation of the recipe as if you go to many restaurants in
        Canada (or at least in the Eastern portions), you will find many like to put different spins on the
        recipe.</p>
    <p>From <em>Italian</em> poutine having spaghetti sauce instead of gravy, to a smoked meat poutine having
        the aforementioned meat added to it, there are numerous combinations of poutine to taste and discover.</p>
